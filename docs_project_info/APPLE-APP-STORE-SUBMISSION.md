## App Review Information

### Demo Account
Not applicable — NostrKey generates its own keys locally.

### Review Notes
```
NostrKey is a Safari Web Extension that implements the NIP-07 standard for Nostr key management. It allows users to:

1. Generate or import Nostr private keys (nsec/hex format)
2. Sign events requested by Nostr-compatible websites via the window.nostr API
3. Encrypt/decrypt messages using NIP-44
4. Connect to remote signers via NIP-46 (nsecBunker)
5. Store encrypted documents in a zero-knowledge vault
6. Sync profiles, settings, and vault data across Apple devices via iCloud (storage.sync, Safari 16+)

To test:
1. Install the extension and enable it in Safari → Settings → Extensions
2. Visit a Nostr web app (e.g., https://snort.social or https://nostrudel.ninja)
3. The app will detect window.nostr and prompt for key access
4. NostrKey will show a permission dialog for user approval

No account or login is needed — the extension generates keys locally.
```
